WICED
=====

This directory should contain the files of the WICED distribution.
Currently, only WICED-SDK-3.4.0-AWS is supported.

You should download `WICED-SDK-3.4.0-AWS.7z.zip` from Broadcom's website,
unpack it (twice), then put the contained directories in this
directory.

Only the `WICED` and `libraries` folders are actually used.
